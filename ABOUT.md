# Goals
  -The switch is interrupted once it's pressed ,make the LED toggle then the LED state is sended to serial monitor over UART protocol
  
  -At the same time the data comes from Temperature sensor is sending to serial monitor with 3 seconds rate
# Thoughts about this task
  -The Temperature sensor (LM35) is analog sensor then we need ADC module to interface with it
 
  -We needed to display our data on Serial monitor then we need UART driver
  
  -No polling in the super loop then the micro will not be busy with no need for that
# learned lessons from the task
  -Good design of the drivers files
  
  -How to make the code more readable with alot of comments and choose suitable names for variables,functions,..etc
  -The Design a README file
  
# Experience in Embedded systems
  -I have taken an embedded diploma during it:
